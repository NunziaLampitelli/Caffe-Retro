# Caffe-Retro
Here can be found two versions of the exercise. 

The first one was done after the first days of CSS learning, where instead of getting a responsive page I needed to create two different files to get the desktop and mobile view. 

The last one is in the "Redone" folder and has been coded again to see the progress difference in my knowledge, a few weeks apart.
